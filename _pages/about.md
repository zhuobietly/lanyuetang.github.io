I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in **Applied Mathematics and Engineering** at **Polytechnic Montreal**. I am co-advised by **Antoine Legrain** and **Antoine Landry-Lesage**.

My research interests include **optimization** and **machine learning**, particularly **optimization-driven modeling**.

I received my **master's degree** from **Tongji University**, where I studied Transportation Engineering. Before that, I received my **undergraduate degree** from **Southeast University**, where I also studied Transportation Engineering.
