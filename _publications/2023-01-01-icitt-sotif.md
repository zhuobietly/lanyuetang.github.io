**Abstract:**  
This paper investigates system-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation for autonomous driving safety analysis under unprotected left-turn scenarios. By incorporating driver behaviour modeling, the proposed framework enhances SOTIF-oriented evaluation of autonomous driving systems in complex traffic interactions.
